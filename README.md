A small FoxLoader (ReIndev) mod that expands the "Block Outline" settings with more practical features!

Also, this mod adds support for custom entity outlines!

Current mod features:
- Several modes for outlines (both block/entity):
  - Static (ARGB, configurable)
  - Rainbow
  - Disabled (invisible)
- Custom width (configurable)

Settings are accessible via "**Options**" -> "**Video Settings...**" -> "**Block/Entity Outline**".
